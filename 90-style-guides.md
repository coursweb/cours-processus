### Moodboards

### Style Tiles

http://styletil.es/

> [Style tiles are] a catalyst for discussions around the preferences and goals of the client." – Samantha Warren

Ethan Marcotte refers to static comps during the responsive design process as a “catalog of assumptions” 

*Style Tiles* are the perfect complement to that catalog, whether it be in place of comps or to reinforce visual themes. Style Tiles don't imply dimensions nor device; only that the design will be digital.

"Style Tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web."


Samantha Warren: [Style Tiles as a Web Design Process Tool](http://badassideas.com/style-tiles-as-a-web-design-process-tool/) (2011)

> "I use the style tile as a starting point to discover if the client’s visual translation of descriptive words and mine are similar. I ask questions that provoke rich answers with lots of adjectives. Tons of adjectives give me great material for kicking off my style tile."

A style tile is a visual “tray” of paint chips, fabric patterns, and color choices that support the client’s goals. I have a Photoshop template with specifically masked areas where, rather than showing paint chips, I display samples of button styles, navigational treatments, and typographic possibilities.

Throughout my design career I have had the opportunity to present comps, mood boards, and style tiles, and I have found that it is really important to use the right tool for the job. 

**Mood boards** work great for startup clients or opportunities where you are designing an identity to go along with a website and you have very limited budgets. It’s great for discovery and brainstorming; distilling big picture feelings and ideas into more clearly defined visuals.

And a **comp** combines all of the research and analysis behind a wireframe and layout with style, and this can be a very difficult thing for a non-designer to understand.

The entire process of layout and user experience discovery can be halted because of color, pattern, or application.  

While they definitely influence each together, separating the two discovery processes allows for iterative progress to be going on simultaneously.


### Element Collages

> My version of Style Tiles integrates my love of collaging for a different type of execution I call an “Element Collage.” That particular phrase creates an expectation that what we’re looking at isn’t a final design but rather an assembly of disparate pieces without specific logic or order. – [Dan Mall](http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/) (2012)

This format represents how I begin to think about designing a site. I often have ideas for pieces of a site in bursts. A full comp often requires ideas to be fully realized. An element collage allows me to document a thought at any state of realization and move on to the next.

### Pattern Library

> I think it’s safe to say a Pattern Library isn’t necessary for every project. But if your site, application, or network of content suffers from style collisions, repeated code, and lack of cohesive UX then a Pattern Library is probably a helpful tool to have. – Dave Rupert, [What I Know About Pattern Libraries](https://daverupert.com/2017/06/what-i-know-about-pattern-libraries/)
