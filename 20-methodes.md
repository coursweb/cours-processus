Définitions selon ZURB

**Methods** are the backbone of the design process. It's deadly tough to build products effectively without developing a few design methods first. 

*Sketching* uncovers interactions, *brainstorming* sparks ideas, *critiquing* pushes the envelope of designs, and *analyzing* discovers what people do with your products. Without these methods, we'd be a little lost.

**Analyzing**
A design method for discovering behavioral patterns in apps and websites.

**Brainstorming**
A design method to test our products and services to make them more awesome and make us better designers.

**Critiquing**
A design method for evaluating a set of existing ideas to identify changes or improvements.

**Concept Testing**
A design method that gets us real data, real fast.

**Interviewing**
A design method for engaging customers on what they think about your products.

**Prototyping**
A design method to test our products and services to make them more awesome and make us better designers.

**QA Testing**
A design method for ensuring the quality of our products and services.

**Sketching**
A design method that helps us quickly get ideas out there, work through problems, explain interaction, and build products.

**User Testing**
A design method to test our products and services to make them more awesome and make us better designers.

Style Tiles

http://styletil.es/

Ethan Marcotte refers to static comps during the responsive design process as a “catalog of assumptions” 

*Style Tiles* are the perfect complement to that catalog, whether it be in place of comps or to reinforce visual themes. Style Tiles don't imply dimensions nor device; only that the design will be digital.

"Style Tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web."



Style Tiles as a Web Design Process Tool (2011)
par Samantha Warren
http://badassideas.com/style-tiles-as-a-web-design-process-tool/

"I use the style tile as a starting point to discover if the client’s visual translation of descriptive words and mine are similar. I ask questions that provoke rich answers with lots of adjectives. Tons of adjectives give me great material for kicking off my style tile."

A style tile is a visual “tray” of paint chips, fabric patterns, and color choices that support the client’s goals. I have a Photoshop template with specifically masked areas where, rather than showing paint chips, I display samples of button styles, navigational treatments, and typographic possibilities.

Throughout my design career I have had the opportunity to present comps, mood boards, and style tiles, and I have found that it is really important to use the right tool for the job. 

**Mood boards** work great for startup clients or opportunities where you are designing an identity to go along with a website and you have very limited budgets. It’s great for discovery and brainstorming; distilling big picture feelings and ideas into more clearly defined visuals.

And a **comp** combines all of the research and analysis behind a wireframe and layout with style, and this can be a very difficult thing for a non-designer to understand.

The entire process of layout and user experience discovery can be halted because of color, pattern, or application.  

While they definitely influence each together, separating the two discovery processes allows for iterative progress to be going on simultaneously.

Daniel Mall:
Element Collages

http://v3.danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/

"My version of Style Tiles integrates my love of collaging for a different type of execution I call an “Element Collage.” That particular phrase creates an expectation that what we’re looking at isn’t a final design but rather an assembly of disparate pieces without specific logic or order."

This format represents how I begin to think about designing a site. I often have ideas for pieces of a site in bursts. A full comp often requires ideas to be fully realized. An element collage allows me to document a thought at any state of realization and move on to the next.

## design kickoff meeting

Have a design kickoff meeting
"Designers should be in every meeting. Be prepared. Have the stakeholders complete a survey before the meeting or have everyone answer questions together."
