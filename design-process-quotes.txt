"Any book on print design focuses on the creative process and spends very little time talking about applications or operating systems. Yet when it comes to Web design, it's all code and browser compatibility."

Design Process, Clients, and Web Standards: An Interview with Jeffrey Zeldman

* Initial Meetings with the Client
"Find the heart of the site, the thing that will solve its business goals and bind it to the hearts of a particular audience, making it essential to them. You need to learn everything the client knows about the product or service, and funnel it through your design expertise."

* Dealing with Multiple Iterations
"Some agencies take three or more designs nearly to completion before asking the client to make a decision. That's a waste of time. It varies by client and project, but Happy Cog's contract indicates they'll show two to three initial designs, and unless they're way off base, they can generally focus on the one that's working best by mutual agreement."

* Modular Design Phase (Templating)

"What a perfect world! Good ol’ waterfall approach, nothing to worry about sprint, backlogs and other iterative gobbledygook."


"Er… what happened to usability testing?
Even a generic web development process needs this important step. See, for example, the ISO standard on web development (ISO 9241-151 ‘Guidance on World Wide Web user interfaces’) "

"I’m sorry but this design process looks a good couple of years behind what many people are moving towards in terms of rapid prototyping in HTML/CSS rather than spending so much time in Fireworks/Photoshop "
