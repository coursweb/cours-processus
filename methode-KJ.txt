Methode KJ:

utilisée par l'équipe SuperFriendly:

"Like any good project, we started by spending some time in-person with the EW.com team. We heard from every team about what they want their workflow challenges and desires. We used the design studio methodology, the KJ technique, and did some one-on-one interviews, among other things."

The KJ-Technique: A Group Process for Establishing Priorities

https://articles.uie.com/kj_technique/

"For this, we’ve turned to a group consensus technique we’ve been using for years, called a KJ-Method (also sometimes referred to as an “affinity diagram”). The KJ-Method, named for its inventor, Jiro Kawakita (the Japanese put their last names first), allows groups to quickly reach a consensus on priorities of subjective, qualitative data."

"When the KJ-Method works (and it has rarely failed us), we reach group consensus much faster than any other method we’ve had. Because we’ve encouraged people from all over the organization to participate, the resulting priorities will typically stand the test of time and won’t come under constant challenge."
